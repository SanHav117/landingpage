<!-- PAGE 7 "Get Certified" -->
<!-- SANCHIT -->

Here,
PAGE 7 <--- Page number from 'Refer.Images.pdf'
"Get Certified" <--- Section to Make
SANCHIT <--- Who has to Make

There are assigned sections in both the html and css file. Add your css code Accordingly.
DO NOT add your code outside your sections.


--/* COMMON STLYES */--

This section is for adding stlyes that apply to most to a large portion of the page.
I've added .sectionName1{black text} and .sectionName2{yellow text} here as the section titles styles are all same.
Same for .contentFont{all content}. This font has been applied to <body>.

--STANDARDS--

1. Give class/id names preferably in camelcase.  Camelcase ---> writeLikeThis    (not compulsary).
2. JavaScript MUST be in camelCase.
3. Use % for Margins. Use % or rem for Padding whenever possible.
4. Final Output should be as close to 'Refer_Images.pdf' as possible.

Ask for help where needed and clear doubts quickly.
Good Luck
